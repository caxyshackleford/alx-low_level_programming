task 1: The woman who has no imagination has no wings

Write a function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, 
which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.

Prototype: char *_strdup(char *str);
The _strdup() function returns a pointer to a new string which is a duplicate of the string str. 
Memory for the new string is obtained with malloc, and can be freed with free.
Returns NULL if str = NULL
On success, the _strdup function returns a pointer to the duplicated string. 
It returns NULL if insufficient memory was available
